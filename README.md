# DSS2100-Final-Assignment

# The 'parameter_estimation.py' file uses a main guard so the file can be imported as a module to draw bootstrap samples of data and boostrap test statistics under the '.draw_bs_reps' function. 
# This file also contains an example of this function in computing 95% confidence intervals for the mean bout length (period of intense activity) for two different types of fish in a given dataset, which may be used in statistical inference in comparing the means of the two types of fish.
